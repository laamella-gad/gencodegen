This is a generic code generator that I have been using in various projects. Next to the generic one, there is a Java code generator.

It keeps track of the basic block structure of code, its hierarchy and indentation, and has a pleasant lack of complexity.

It solves the following problems:

* It is hard to keep indentation correct.
* You won't generate the file from start to end, you will jump around adding stuff.
* Generating code with a full Java AST will lead to an unreadable amount of method calls. (DSL hell :D )

The basic "Block" class solves these problems.
By building a hierarchy of pieces of code and rendering them in a separate step, it is possible to add pieces all over the hierarchy at any time.
It knows at which indentation it should render itself, and you can change the indentation of child pieces before adding them.
It provides only a few methods, and the sub-projects for specific languages only add the bare minimum of DSL functionality.
